# skin_lesions
Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the way humans solves problem, and I personally thinks this will be possible in a near future and this is the reasoon, I am working on this project.
The project is not yet complete and open to new ideas.

# Skin Lesion Detection System

A modern AI-powered web application for **skin lesion analysis and skin cancer risk prediction**.  
Being built to assist clinicians and researchers with fast, accessible, and reliable image-based diagnostics predictions

---

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**  
  Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) for accurate prediction and segmentation of skin lesions (melanoma, benign, etc.).

- **Web-Based User Interface**  
  Clean dashboard for uploading images, visualizing results, and managing predictions.

- **Secure & Role-Based Access**  
  User authentication with JWT. Support for admin and regular user roles.

- **Modular & Scalable Architecture**  
  Separated frontend and backend for flexibility and easy scaling.
