        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Born and raised in <strong>Bukavu</strong>, a vibrant city nestled in the heart of Africa‚Äôs Great Lakes, I discovered my passion for technology against all odds. As a child in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, owning a computer was a distant dream. My father worked tirelessly just to give me the chance to visit a local cybercaf√©, where I could write emails to friends who had fled the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of others, I learned to communicate online, eventually creating my first email address. These early connections sparked a fascination with how technology could bridge continents, reunite communities, and open doors to knowledge.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by my journey, I founded <strong>Tuunganes</strong> an initiative focused on digital empowerment for my hometown of Bukavu and beyond. We teach students about ICT, build digital systems, and believe that every step no matter how small moves us closer to a brighter future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Image Analysis Project</strong> is more than just software. It's a blueprint for how technology can revolutionize healthcare, starting with cancer detection, but expanding to all aspects of <strong>eHealth</strong>. Our vision is to make advanced diagnostics, digital literacy, and life-changing tools accessible to everyone starting in Bukavu, and growing step by step.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          ‚ÄúWe believe that technology, when shared with open hearts and minds, can transform lives and create hope even in the face of great challenges.‚Äù
