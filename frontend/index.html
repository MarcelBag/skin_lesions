    <h2>Why Artificial Intelligence for Skin Cancer?</h2>
    <p>
      In 2019, pioneers Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio received the 
      <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Award</a> for their breakthroughs in neural networks, driving today’s AI revolution. 
      Their innovations are now transforming not only how we drive cars or interact with technology, but also how we detect and diagnose disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Early and accurate diagnosis</strong> is the key to beating deadly diseases like cancer. Yet, traditional medical diagnostics—especially for skin cancer—remain challenging, subjective, and often inaccessible in many parts of the world.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Each year, over 10 million people die of cancer globally.</strong></li>
      <li>
        Skin cancer rates are rising, with early detection critical for survival—
        <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization: Cancer Facts</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        AI can analyze skin images rapidly, consistently, and objectively, reducing risk of misdiagnosis and bringing expert analysis to more people.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By harnessing AI, we can empower doctors and patients with <strong>faster, more accurate, and more widely accessible tools</strong>—helping save lives and transform healthcare for everyone, everywhere.

        <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Early, precise detection is crucial, but time-consuming and sometimes subjective.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Opportunity:</strong> Algorithms can identify subtle patterns in skin images that humans might miss.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automation allows healthcare workers to focus on complex tasks and reach underserved areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics & Data:</strong> Data privacy, bias, and ongoing model validation are important for real-world impact.</li>

        <h3>From Turing’s Test to Modern Medical AI</h3>
        <p>
          In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1950, Alan Turing</a> imagined a test to see if a machine could imitate a human. 
          While his ideas inspired decades of research, they also created both excitement and some misconceptions about AI's true capabilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          AI’s founders, including 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John McCarthy</a> and 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvin Minsky</a>, built early neural network machines—paving the way for today's deep learning breakthroughs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In healthcare, <strong>predictive AI</strong> helps anticipate risks before they happen and enables early detection of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, or even new pandemics. 
          Deep learning now allows computers to learn from massive medical datasets, making accurate, early diagnoses more accessible than ever.
        </p>

          AI models such as neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines are transforming how we classify patients, predict health risks, and guide treatments.
