    <h2>Why Artificial Intelligence for Skin Cancer?</h2>
    <p>
      In 2019, pioneers Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio received the Turing Award for their breakthroughs in neural networks, driving today’s artificial intelligence revolution. Their innovations are now transforming not only how we drive cars or interact with technology, but also how we detect and diagnose disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Early and accurate diagnosis</strong> is the key to beating deadly diseases like cancer. Yet, traditional medical diagnostics—especially for skin cancer—remain challenging, subjective, and often inaccessible in many parts of the world.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Each year, over 10 million people die of cancer globally.</strong></li>
      <li>Skin cancer rates are rising, with early detection critical for survival—yet many regions lack access to specialists or advanced diagnostics.</li>
      <li>AI can analyze skin images rapidly, consistently, and objectively, reducing risk of misdiagnosis and bringing expert analysis to more people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By harnessing AI, we can empower doctors and patients with <strong>faster, more accurate, and more widely accessible tools</strong>—helping save lives and transform healthcare for everyone, everywhere.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Early, precise detection is crucial, but time-consuming and sometimes subjective.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Opportunity:</strong> Algorithms can identify subtle patterns in skin images that humans might miss.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automation allows healthcare workers to focus on complex tasks and reach underserved areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics & Data:</strong> Data privacy, bias, and ongoing model validation are important for real-world impact.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project is inspired by the latest research, global health needs, and a commitment to making diagnostics better for all.
